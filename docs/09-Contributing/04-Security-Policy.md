# Security Policy

> The canonical security policy lives at the repository root in
> [`SECURITY.md`](../../SECURITY.md).
> GitHub surfaces that file automatically under the repo's
> **Security → Policy** tab, so it is the single source of truth.

Read the full policy here: **[SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md)**

## Why a Separate Root File?

GitHub requires `SECURITY.md` at the repository root (or inside `.github/`)
to populate the **Security** tab that external researchers see first.
Keeping the policy there — and only there — avoids duplication and ensures
every update is immediately visible on the platform.

For details on how we **implement** security (IAM, RLS, scanning, etc.),
see [07-Operations / Security.md](../07-Operations/04-Security.md).
